\section*{Image Filtering} 
I used Fast Fourier Transformation to implement image filtering. \par
First, I padded the image with zeros according to the size of filter. For top and bottom of the pixel matrix, "floor(filter$\_$size(1) / 2)" rows of 0 were added, and for right and left of the pixel matrix, "floor(filter$\_$size(2) / 2)" columns of 0 were added (filter$\_$size = size(filter)). I also padded the filter using the same size and put the actual filter on the upper left corner.\par
Then, I ran a loop k many times, where dimension of the image is m $\times$ n $\times$ k. So, if the image is grayscale, the loop is run 1 time, and if the image is colored, the loop if run 3 times. Inside the loop, I found Fast Fourier Transformation of padded image and padded filter using fft2 function. I then found padded convolution by multiplying elements of padded image and padded filter. I then used ifft2 function to find image of that product and found appropriate portion to unpad the image. \par
Shown below is the code snippet: \par
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
filter_size = size(filter);
if rem(filter_size(1), 2) == 0 || rem(filter_size(2), 2) == 0
    error("Error: even-sized filter!");
end

filter_row = floor(filter_size(1)/2);
filter_col = floor(filter_size(2)/2);
image_size = size(image);

pimage = padarray(image, [filter_row, filter_col]);
pimage_size = size(pimage);
pfilter = zeros(pimage_size(1), pimage_size(2));
pfilter(1:filter_size(1), 1:filter_size(2)) = filter;
ret = zeros(image_size);

for k = 1:image_size(3)
    f_image = fft2(pimage(:,:,k));
    f_filter = fft2(pfilter);
    padded_conv = ifft2(f_image .* f_filter);
    ret(:,:,k) = padded_conv(2 * filter_row + 1 : pimage_size(1), 2 * filter_col + 1 : pimage_size(2));
end 
output = ret;
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Hybrid Image}

For part 2, I implemented the function gen$\_$hybrid$\_$image(image1, image2, cutoff$\_$frequency). This function first filters image1 through a low pass filter and image2 through a high pass filter. Then, it adds those two outputs up to create a new hybrid image. \par
First, I created a square n $\times$ n Gaussian filter, where n is 2 $\times$ cutoff$\_$frequency $+$ 1, and standard deviation is cutoff$\_$frequency. Then, low$\_$frequencies was calculated by filtering image1 through the filter, creating a blurred version of image1. Likewise, high$\_$frequencies was calculated by subtracting blurred version of image2 - that was created by filtering image2 with filter - from image2 itself. Finally, I simply added those two matrices up to get hybrid$\_$image. \par
Shown below is the code snippet:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove high frequency to produce low frequencies only
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
filter = fspecial('Gaussian', cutoff_frequency*2+1, cutoff_frequency);
high_pass_image = my_imfilter(image1, filter);
high_pass_image = my_imfilter(high_pass_image, filter');
low_frequencies = [high_pass_image];

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove low frequency to produce high frequencies only
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
low_pass_image = my_imfilter(image2, filter);
low_pass_image = my_imfilter(low_pass_image, filter');
low_pass_image = image2 - low_pass_image;
high_frequencies = [low_pass_image];

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Combine the high frequencies and low frequencies
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
hybrid_image = [high_pass_image + low_pass_image];
\end{lstlisting}
