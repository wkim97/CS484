% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing

% it into a PDF document. 
%
% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): www.latex-project.org/get/
% - We recommend latex compiler miktex (https://miktex.org/) for windows,
%   macTex (http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS users.
%   And TeXstudio(http://www.texstudio.org/) for latex editor.
%   You should install both compiler and editor for editing latex.
%   The another option is Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) which is 
%   an online latex editor.
%
% If you need help with LaTeX, please come to office hours. 
% Or, there is plenty of help online:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe any interesting decisions you made to write your algorithm.
  \item Show and discuss the results of your algorithm.
  \item Feel free to include code snippets, images, and equations.
  \item Use as many pages as you need, but err on the short side If you feel you only need to write a short amount to meet the brief, th

\section*{get$\_$interest$\_$points.m}
For the function get$\_$interest$\_$points, I used a normal Harris corner detection method. I followed the algorithms below to implement Harris corner detection: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute image derivatives by applying sobel filters to image.
	\item Compute M components as squares of derivatives by finding $I_x^2$, $I_y^2$, and $I_xI_y$.
	\item Apply a Gaussian filter of size $[4,4]$ and width $2$ to each of $I_x^2$, $I_y^2$, and $I_xI_y$.
	\item Compute cornerness $\text{C} = \text{det(M)} - \alpha \text{trace(M)}^2$.
	\item Apply threshold on C to pick high cornerness.
	\item Non-maxima suppression to pick peaks. I used function colfilt() to find maximum peaks.
\end{enumerate}
